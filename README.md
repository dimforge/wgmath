**wgmath** is a set of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) libraries exposing
re-usable [WebGPU](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/) shaders for scientific computing including:

- The [**wgcore** crate](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/tree/main/crates/wgcore), a centerpiece of the **wgmath**
  ecosystem, exposes a set of proc-macros to facilitate sharing and composing shaders across Rust libraries.
- Linear algebra with the [**wgebra** crate](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/tree/main/crates/wgebra).
- AI (Large Language Models) with the [**wgml** crate](https://github.com/dimforge/wgml/tree/main).
- Collision-detection with the
  [**wgparry2d** and **wgparry3d**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/tree/main/crates/wgparry) crates (still very
  WIP).
- Rigid-body physics with the
  [**wgrapier2d** and **wgrapier3d**](https://github.com/dimforge/wgmath/tree/main/crates/wgrapier3d) crates (still very
  WIP).

By targeting WebGPU, these libraries run on most GPUs, including on mobile and on the web. It aims to promote open and
cross-platform GPU computing for scientific applications, a field currently strongly dominated by proprietary
solutions (like CUDA).

⚠️ All these libraries are still under heavy development and might be lacking some important features. Contributions
are welcome!
